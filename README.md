# Hotel Reservation System

This project is a **front-end implementation** of a hotel reservation system, designed to simplify the booking process for users. The front-end is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, while the back-end (developed by my teammates) uses a MySQL database.

## Technologies Used
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Design**: Figma
- **Back-End**: MySQL (handled by teammates)

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
1. **XAMPP**: Install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) to set up a local server and MySQL database.
2. **Database Setup**:
   - Start Apache and MySQL in XAMPP.
   - Open phpMyAdmin (usually at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
   - Create a new database named `hotel_reservation_system`.
   - Import the `hotel_reservation_system.sql` file into the database:
     - Click on the database name (`hotel_reservation_system`).
     - Go to the **Import** tab.
     - Choose the `hotel_reservation_system.sql` file and click **Go**.

### Running the Front-End
1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Place the project folder in the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs\hotel-reservation-system`).
3. Start your browser and navigate to: http://localhost/hotel-reservation-system
4.The front-end should now be running and connected to the database.

## My Role
- **Front-End Development**: I designed and developed the entire front-end of the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Design**: I created wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes in Figma to ensure a user-friendly interface.
- **Collaboration**: I worked closely with my teammates, who handled the back-end development, to ensure seamless integration.

## Notes
- The back-end (database and server-side logic) was developed by my teammates. This repository contains only the front-end code.
- If you encounter any issues, ensure that the database is properly set up and the XAMPP server is running.
